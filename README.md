## Project
This repo was created as part of our VOP-project **Kubernetes**.

Please checkout https://github.com/vop-2020-kubernetes/k8s-deployment. In that repo we gathered all information on what applications we deployed an what apps solve what problems.

## Node Express template project

This project is based on a GitLab [Project Template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/create-project.html).

Improvements can be proposed in the [original project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/project-templates/express).

## Changes

We started from the gitlab [Auto DevOps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/) scripts and added Helm 3 and Istio support.
